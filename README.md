# Biomedical-Technologies
Development of an app in the course Biomedical Wearable Technologies for Healthcare and Wellbeing.
The app has a goal to use data collected from a fit-bit watch, and use steps and callories to map out both movement radius and calorie deficit/bulk 
to suggest stores nearby that sell food that will "help".
